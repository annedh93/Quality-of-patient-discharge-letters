# Quality-of-patient-discharge-letters

## Background 
Large Language Models like GPT hold immense potential for reducing administrative burden in the healthcare domain. Before deployment and upscaling in clinical practice, validation is a crucial step to assess the quality, safety, and usability of Large Language Models for any specific healthcare task or application. This study assessed the quality of GPT-generated draft discharge letters in comparison to physician-written discharge letters based on Dutch patient records.
